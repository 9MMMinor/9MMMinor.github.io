Micropython graphics (GFX) and fonts for ILI9225 display for Raspberry Pi Pico

TFT_22_ILI9225.py adafruit_gfx.py gfxFont.py glcFont.py
Python code

The following code has been tested on Raspberry Pi Pico W. With the exception of the examples, all .py modules were saved to the Raspberry Pi Pico using, for example, Thonny.

The driver object, TFT_22_ILI9225, is derived from: v1.4.5

The graphics library object, GFX, is minimally edited from CircuitPython pixel graphics drawing library: (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_GFX.git). A Method, drawBitmap, to draw XBitMap files (.xbm) exported from GIMP, has been added.

A font object, glcFont, is derived from font methods found in: (https://github.com/Nkawu/TFT_22_ILI9225/releases/tag/v1.4.5), which use fonts generated by MikroElektronika GLCD Font Creator 1.2.0.0, MikroElektronika 2011, http://www.mikroe.com.

A font object, gfxFont, is derived from font method, drawGFXChar(), found in TFT_22_ILI9225.cpp (see github.com/Nkawu, above), in which character glyphs are separated from the character bitmaps. These are the font structures used in Adafruit_GFX 1.1 and later.
Introduction

This is a library for the ILI9225 based 2.2" 176x220 TFT LCD shields commonly found on eBay, originally forked from the screen_4D_22_library library. The ability to use GLCD fonts has been added and the syntax has been changed to match the Adafruit libraries somewhat.
